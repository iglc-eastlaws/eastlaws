//dapper-dot-net
worth to take a look ,  Dapper.net
https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net

what i noticed
-- deal with objects and list without lose performance
-- write pure sql query (our problem)
-- I can make realtion between two database ( our problem)
-- too easy to learn (just take half hour to install and test ), in fact no time to learn I just write sql query
-- prevent from sql injection
-- mixed between  raw ado.net and entity framework 
-- created and maintanance by stackoverflow team
-- tested by millions of developers
